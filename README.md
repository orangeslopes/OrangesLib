## What is this?
OrangesLib is a Java library for creating Paper plugins
and easing complications in coding redundant features, to not bore developers
to death when working on the same stuff again.

## What does this library offer?
Some of many helper methods and abstract objects to be used anywhere! Our objective
we set for this library is to ease up the developer as much as possible.
Here is a list of `Helper` classes that you can use:

| Class                                                                               | Description                                                                                 |
